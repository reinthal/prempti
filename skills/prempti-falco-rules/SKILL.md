description: Author custom Falco rules for Prempti — the policy and visibility layer for AI coding agents. Use this skill whenever the user asks to create, edit, or debug rules that control what coding agents (Claude Code, etc.) can do. Triggers on phrases like "add a rule", "block this tool", "deny access to", "allow writes to", "create a security policy", "custom Falco rule for coding agent", or any request to modify files under rules/user/. This skill covers the coding_agent plugin source and its specific fields — NOT syscall rules.

# Prempti Falco Rules Author

Write custom Falco rules that govern what AI coding agents can do at runtime. These rules intercept tool calls (shell commands, file writes/reads, MCP calls) and enforce allow/deny/ask verdicts before execution.

## Context: How This System Works

Prempti intercepts every tool call a coding agent makes. Each call becomes a Falco event with structured fields. Your rules evaluate these events and decide the verdict:

- **deny** — block the tool call entirely (the agent sees an explanation)
- **ask** — prompt the user for confirmation (they see your output message directly)
- **allow** — no tag needed; tool calls that match no deny/ask rule are allowed

The agent sees the verdict reason as: `"Rule Name: <your output message> | For AI Agents: ... | correlation=<id>"`. For deny verdicts, the LLM reformulates this for the user. For ask verdicts, the user reads your output message directly in a permission prompt — so write it for a human audience.

## Available Fields

Every tool call event exposes these fields for conditions and output:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `correlation.id` | u64 | Unique event ID (always > 0, auto-included in output_fields) |
| `agent.name` | string | Agent identifier (e.g., `claude_code`) |
| `agent.os` | string | Host OS: `linux`, `macos`, `windows`, or `unknown` |
| `agent.pid` | u64 | PID of the agent process that invoked the hook (auto-included in output_fields). `0` when the platform lookup fails. |
| `agent.hook_event_name` | string | Hook lifecycle point (e.g., `PreToolUse`) |
| `agent.session_id` | string | Session identifier |
| `agent.model` | string | Model identifier (Codex-only; empty for Claude Code) |
| `agent.turn_id` | string | Turn identifier within a session (Codex-only; empty for Claude Code) |
| `agent.cwd` | string | Working directory as reported by the agent |
| `agent.real_cwd` | string | Working directory resolved to absolute canonical path |
| `agent.real_cwd_prefix` | string | Resolved working directory with one trailing `/`; use for path containment checks |
| `tool.name` | string | Tool name: `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Agent`, etc. |
| `tool.use_id` | string | Unique identifier for this tool call |
| `tool.input` | string | Full tool input as JSON |
| `tool.input_command` | string | Shell command (Bash tool only, empty otherwise) |
| `tool.file_path` | string | Target file path, raw (Write/Edit/Read only) |
| `tool.file_name` | string | Final component of the target path before symlink resolution |
| `tool.real_file_path` | string | Target file path resolved to absolute canonical path (Write/Edit/Read only) |
| `tool.patch_op` | string | Codex `apply_patch` operation: `Add`, `Update`, `Delete`, or `Move` (empty otherwise) |
| `agent.permission_mode` | string | Session permission mode: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `bypassPermissions` (Codex also emits `dontAsk`) |
| `agent.transcript_path` | string | Session transcript file path (empty when the agent reports `null`) |
| `agent.id` | string | Claude Code subagent instance identifier (empty for the main session / Codex) |
| `agent.type` | string | Claude Code subagent type, e.g. `Explore`, `Plan` (empty for the main session / Codex) |

Path fields come in raw/real pairs. Use `real_*` for path policy matching (resolved, absolute). Use raw fields for display. For policies based on a file name, match `tool.file_name` **or** `basename(tool.real_file_path)` so both sensitive symlink aliases and sensitive canonical targets are covered.

## Rule Structure

Every rule needs these fields:

```yaml
- rule: <Human-readable name>
  desc: >
    <What this rule does and why>
  condition: >
    <Boolean expression using fields above>
  output: >
    <LLM-friendly message starting with "Falco">
  priority: <CRITICAL|WARNING|NOTICE|DEBUG>
  source: coding_agent
  tags: [<verdict tag>]
```

### Tags (verdict)

| Tag | Effect | Priority convention |
|-----|--------|---------------------|
| `coding_agent_deny` | Block the tool call | CRITICAL or ERROR |
| `coding_agent_ask` | Require user confirmation | WARNING |
| (empty `[]`) | Informational / audit only | NOTICE or INFORMATIONAL |

All Falco priorities are valid: `EMERGENCY`, `ALERT`, `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `INFORMATIONAL` (or `INFO`), `DEBUG`.

When multiple rules match the same event, verdicts escalate: **deny > ask > {allow | defer}**. The lowest tier is the no-rule-match floor (`default_action`: `allow` by default, or `defer` to defer to the agent's own permission system) — deny/ask rules are unaffected by it.

### Output Convention

The `output:` field is the message the coding agent (or user) sees. Write it as a clear, self-contained sentence:

- Start with "Falco" to attribute the verdict
- Use `%field` to interpolate resolved values (e.g., `%tool.real_file_path`)
- Do NOT include structured `key=value` pairs — those are handled automatically by `append_output`
- For **deny** rules: write for an LLM audience (it will rephrase for the user)
- For **ask** rules: write for a human audience (they read it directly in the permission prompt)

```yaml
# Good:
output: >
  Falco blocked running sudo because elevated privileges are not permitted

# Bad (structured fields leak into user-facing message):
output: >
  Denied | cmd=%tool.input_command correlation=%correlation.id
```

## Condition Language Quick Reference

### Operators

| Operator | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `=`, `!=` | `tool.name = "Bash"` |
| `contains` | `tool.input_command contains "rm -rf"` |
| `icontains` | `tool.input_command icontains "password"` — case-insensitive contains |
| `startswith`, `endswith` | `tool.real_file_path startswith "/etc/"` |
| `in` | `tool.name in ("Write", "Edit")` |
| `pmatch` | `tool.real_file_path pmatch (sensitive_paths)` — prefix match against a list |
| `glob` | `tool.real_file_path glob "/home/*/secrets/*"` — wildcard pattern matching |
| `regex` | `tool.input_command regex "curl.*\|.*sh"` — RE2 regular expression |
| `exists` | `tool.file_path exists` — field has a value (cleaner than `!= ""`) |
| `and`, `or`, `not` | Boolean combinators |

### Transformers

| Transformer | Usage |
|-------------|-------|
| `val()` | Field-to-field comparison: `tool.real_file_path startswith val(agent.real_cwd_prefix)` |
| `basename()` | Extract the canonical target filename: `basename(tool.real_file_path) = ".env"` (POSIX split on `/`; `real_file_path` is normalized to forward slashes on every platform). Combine it with `tool.file_name` for alias-aware policies. |
| `tolower()` | Case-insensitive comparison: `tolower(tool.input_command) startswith "sudo "` |
| `len()` | String length: `len(tool.input_command) > 1000` — detect anomalous inputs |

Transformers can be chained: `basename(tolower(tool.real_file_path))`.

Without `val()`, the right-hand side is a literal string, not a field reference.

### Lists and Macros

Lists define reusable sets of values. Macros define reusable condition fragments.

```yaml
- list: my_blocked_commands
  items: [rm, mkfs, dd, fdisk]

- macro: is_blocked_command
  condition: >
    tool.input_command startswith "rm -rf"
    or tool.input_command startswith "mkfs"

- rule: Deny dangerous commands
  condition: >
    tool.name = "Bash"
    and is_blocked_command
  ...
```

### Override and Append

The `override` key modifies existing rules, macros, and lists across files — essential for customizing defaults without editing them:

```yaml
# In rules/user/my_overrides.yaml:

# Add paths to the default sensitive_paths list
- list: sensitive_paths
  items: [/opt/secrets/]
  override:
    items: append

# Add conditions to the default is_sensitive_path macro
- macro: is_sensitive_path
  condition: or tool.real_file_path contains "/.vault/"
  override:
    condition: append

# Disable an existing rule
- rule: Monitor activity outside working directory
  enabled: false
  override:
    enabled: replace

# Change a rule's priority
- rule: Ask before writing outside working directory
  priority: CRITICAL
  override:
    priority: replace

# Append an extra condition to an existing rule
- rule: Deny writing to sensitive paths
  condition: and not tool.real_file_path startswith "/etc/my-app/"
  override:
    condition: append
```

**Appendable** fields: `condition`, `output`, `desc`, `tags`, `exceptions`.
**Replaceable** fields: all appendable fields plus `priority`, `enabled`.

## Where to Put Rules

The Prempti rule layout has three locations:

- **Default rules**: `rules/default/coding_agents_rules.yaml` — shipped with the project, overwritten on upgrade
- **User rules**: `rules/user/*.yaml` — preserved across upgrades, this is where custom rules belong
- **Seen rule**: `rules/seen.yaml` — DO NOT modify, required for verdict resolution

These paths exist in two contexts:

| Context | `rules/default/` | `rules/user/` |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Project repo | source-controlled defaults | empty (`.gitkeep`); contributors add new rules here |
| Installed system | `~/.prempti/rules/default/` (Linux/macOS) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\prempti\rules\default\` (Windows) | corresponding `rules/user/` under the same prefix |

**Important constraint on the installed system**: Prempti's self-protection rules block Write/Edit on any path under the install prefix while the service is running, and deny **every** `premptictl` invocation. The agent cannot directly install or apply a rule on a running Prempti — the user must perform the manual install workflow described in [Applying Rules to a Running Prempti](#applying-rules-to-a-running-prempti).

In the project repo, drafting into `rules/user/` is fine because those paths aren't under the install prefix.

Before writing a new rule, read `rules/default/coding_agents_rules.yaml` to check for overlaps. The default ruleset is organized into seven sections covering common AI-agent attack surfaces:

1. **Working-directory boundary** — monitor / ask on file access outside the session cwd
2. **Sensitive paths** — deny reads and writes to `/etc/`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`, `.env` files, etc.
3. **Sandbox disable** — Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI sandbox-disable attempts (Write, Edit, and Bash variants)
4. **Threats** — credential access, destructive shell commands, pipe-to-shell, encoded payloads, curl/wget exfiltration, IMDS access, credential archives, SSH covert tunnels, cron persistence, history wipe, package publish, shell startup files, agent instruction files outside cwd, cross-agent auth file reads, MCP installs from untrusted hosts, MCP execution from temp dirs, credential glob patterns
5. **MCP and skill content** — MCP config poisoning (`.mcp.json`), slash-command and skill file injection (`.claude/commands/`, `.claude/skills/`), Claude Code subagent and plugin storage (`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/plugins/`), settings backups (`.claude/backups/`)
6. **Persistence vectors** — settings hooks, settings-level mcpServers, git hooks, package registry redirects, `.env` API base-URL overrides, AI API keys in env files
7. **Self-protection** — block agent attempts to disable Prempti: every `premptictl` invocation, platform service-stop alternatives (systemctl / launchctl / taskkill / pkill), writes under the install prefix, and writes to Claude Code config files (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `policy-limits.json`)

The file also exposes reusable lists (`sensitive_paths`, `sensitive_file_names`, `shell_startup_files`, `agent_instruction_files`, `env_file_names`, `registry_config_files`) and macros (`is_sensitive_path`, `is_outside_cwd`, `is_claude_data_path`, `is_write_tool`, `contains_ioc_domain`, `cmd_contains_ioc_domain`) that user rules can extend via `override: append`.

If the user's request overlaps with an existing rule, prefer extending it via `override: append` rather than creating a duplicate. If the new rule is more restrictive (e.g., deny where the default only asks), explain the interaction to the user.

## Applying Rules to a Running Prempti

The agent **cannot install or apply a rule on a running Prempti** by itself. Two self-protection rules make this a user-driven operation:

- `Deny writes under Prempti install prefix` blocks Write/Edit on any path under `~/.prempti/` (or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\prempti\` on Windows), including `rules/user/`.
- `Deny premptictl invocation` blocks every agent-invoked `premptictl` command — even read-only ones like `status`, `health`, `logs`.

This is by design: the agent is the threat model the rules defend against, so it cannot be trusted to author and load its own policy.

### Workflow

1. **Draft the rule to a path the agent can write to** — typically the current working directory (`./<rule-name>.yaml`), the project repo's `rules/user/` if the user is contributing back, or a scratch location like `/tmp/<rule-name>.yaml`. Do **not** attempt to write directly into `~/.prempti/rules/user/` — Prempti will deny it.
2. **Validate the draft with Falco** (see [Validation](#validation)). Validation works on any path; the rule does not need to be installed.
3. **Hand the install steps to the user**. The agent cannot run these — the user copies and runs them themselves. Substitute the actual draft path and a descriptive rule filename.

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
# 1. Stop Prempti — this unregisters the hook, so writes under ~/.prempti/ pass through
premptictl stop

# 2. Copy the validated rule into the user rules directory
cp <draft-path> ~/.prempti/rules/user/<rule-name>.yaml

# 3. Start Prempti — the new rule is loaded and the hook is re-registered
premptictl start
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
# 1. Stop Prempti
premptictl stop

# 2. Copy the validated rule into the user rules directory
Copy-Item <draft-path> "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\prempti\rules\user\<rule-name>.yaml"

# 3. Start Prempti
premptictl start
```

4. **Wait for the user to confirm** `premptictl start` succeeded. The new rule is live only after start completes — between step 1 and step 3, Prempti's interception is off and tool calls pass through unmonitored, so the user knows this window exists.

### Notes

- If the user prefers a single command, `premptictl restart` after the `cp` is equivalent to `stop` → re-add hook → `start`.
- Removing the rule later follows the same pattern: `premptictl stop`, `rm ~/.prempti/rules/user/<name>.yaml`, `premptictl start`.
- If the user is running Prempti in **monitor mode** (`premptictl mode monitor`), writes to the install prefix will still produce a deny alert in logs but tool calls succeed — the user can technically skip the stop/start, but the alert is noise and the canonical workflow above is preferred either way.

## Validation

After writing a rule, always validate it with Falco. The validation step catches syntax errors, unknown fields, and malformed conditions before the rule goes live.

### Finding the Falco binary

Check these locations in order. The "installed" locations are written by the platform packagers; the "development build" locations are produced by `make falco-*` and `make download-falco-linux`.

**Linux / macOS**

1. **Installed binary** (most common): `~/.prempti/bin/falco`
2. **System PATH**: `falco` (if installed globally)
3. **Development build**: `build/falco-*-<arch>/usr/bin/falco` (Linux, downloaded) or `build/falco-*-darwin-<arch>/falco` (macOS, source)

**Windows** (PowerShell)

1. **Installed binary**: `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\prempti\bin\falco.exe`
2. **System PATH**: `falco.exe` (rare on Windows — `PATH` usually points to the installed bin dir via the post-install step)
3. **Development build**: `build\falco-0.44.0-windows-<arch>\falco.exe` (built via `make falco-windows-x64` / `falco-windows-arm64`)

### Running validation

Use the installed config so the plugin is loaded and all fields are recognized. Validate the **draft** file at whatever path it currently lives — validation does not require the rule to be installed under the Prempti prefix (and the agent cannot put it there until the user runs the manual install steps).

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
~/.prempti/bin/falco \
  -c ~/.prempti/config/falco.yaml \
  --disable-source syscall \
  -V <draft-path>      # e.g. ./my_rules.yaml or /tmp/my_rules.yaml
```

**Windows** (PowerShell)

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\prempti\bin\falco.exe" `
  -c "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\prempti\config\falco.yaml" `
  --disable-source syscall `
  -V <draft-path>
```

This validates:
- YAML syntax and rule structure
- Field names exist in the `coding_agent` source (catches typos like `tool.command` instead of `tool.input_command`)
- Condition expression syntax (operators, transformers, list/macro references)
- Output template field references

If validation passes, Falco exits 0. If it fails, the error message tells you exactly which rule and which field or expression has the problem.

### Common Validation Errors

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `LOAD_ERR_COMPILE_CONDITION` | Syntax error in condition — undefined macro, invalid field, bad operator |
| `LOAD_ERR_COMPILE_OUTPUT` | Invalid field reference in output template |
| `LOAD_ERR_YAML_VALIDATE` | YAML structure error — missing required field, wrong type |
| `LOAD_ERR_YAML_PARSE` | Malformed YAML — bad indentation, missing quotes, invalid syntax |
| `LOAD_UNKNOWN_FILTER` | Unknown field name — check spelling against the fields table |
| `LOAD_UNKNOWN_SOURCE` | Unknown event source — check for typos in `source:` (must be `coding_agent`) |
| `LOAD_UNUSED_MACRO` | Macro defined but not referenced by any rule or other macro |
| `LOAD_UNUSED_LIST` | List defined but not referenced by any rule, macro, or other list |

Warnings must also be fixed. If validation reports `LOAD_UNUSED_MACRO` or `LOAD_UNUSED_LIST`, remove the unused macro or list from the file. Do not ship rules with unused definitions.

### If Falco is not available

If neither the installed binary nor a development build is found, validate manually:
- `source: coding_agent` is set
- Field names match the table above exactly
- `val()` is used for field-to-field comparisons
- Tags are one of `coding_agent_deny`, `coding_agent_ask`, or empty `[]`
- Output starts with "Falco"

Flag to the user that the rule was not machine-validated.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| `tool.real_file_path startswith agent.real_cwd` | RHS is a literal string `"agent.real_cwd"`, not a field | Use `val()`: `startswith val(agent.real_cwd)` |
| `source: syscall` or missing `source:` | Wrong event source — defaults to syscall | Always set `source: coding_agent` |
| `output: "Denied cmd=%tool.input_command id=%correlation.id"` | Structured fields leak into user-facing message | Keep output clean; structured fields are in output_fields automatically |
| `tool.input_command contains "rm"` | Matches `rm`, but also `mkdir`, `chmod`, `arm64` | Use `startswith "rm "` or `startswith "rm -"` for precision |
| `tags: [deny]` | Wrong tag name — broker won't recognize it | Use `coding_agent_deny` or `coding_agent_ask` |
| Editing `rules/default/` or `seen.yaml` | Overwritten on upgrade / breaks verdict resolution | Write to `rules/user/`; use `override:` to modify defaults |
| Writing directly into `~/.prempti/rules/user/` while Prempti is running | Self-protection blocks all Write/Edit under the install prefix | Draft to cwd or a scratch path, validate, then hand the user the manual install steps (see "Applying Rules to a Running Prempti") |
| Asking the agent to run `premptictl ...` | Self-protection denies every `premptictl` invocation | The user runs `premptictl` commands; the agent presents the steps and waits for confirmation |
| Using `tool.input_command` without `tool.name = "Bash"` | `tool.input_command` is empty for non-Bash tools — condition silently never matches | Always guard with `tool.name = "Bash" and ...` |
| Creating a rule that overlaps with defaults | User gets unexpected double verdicts or confusion | Read `rules/default/` first; extend with `override:` or explain the interaction |

## Examples

### Deny: block destructive shell commands

```yaml
- rule: Deny destructive shell commands
  desc: >
    Blocks rm -rf, mkfs, dd, and other destructive commands that could
    cause irreversible damage to the filesystem.
  condition: >
    tool.name = "Bash"
    and (tool.input_command contains "rm -rf"
         or tool.input_command startswith "mkfs"
         or tool.input_command startswith "dd ")
  output: >
    Falco blocked a destructive command (%tool.input_command)
  priority: CRITICAL
  source: coding_agent
  tags: [coding_agent_deny]
```

### Ask: confirm before running network commands

```yaml
- rule: Ask before network commands
  desc: >
    Requires user confirmation before the agent runs curl, wget, or
    similar network tools that could exfiltrate data.
  condition: >
    tool.name = "Bash"
    and (tool.input_command startswith "curl "
         or tool.input_command startswith "wget "
         or tool.input_command contains "| curl"
         or tool.input_command contains "| wget")
  output: >
    Falco requires confirmation for a network command (%tool.input_command)
  priority: WARNING
  source: coding_agent
  tags: [coding_agent_ask]
```

### Deny: prevent writing outside a project boundary

```yaml
- list: allowed_write_prefixes
  items:
    - /home/user/myproject/

- rule: Deny writes outside project
  desc: >
    Restricts file writes to a specific project directory.
  condition: >
    tool.name in ("Write", "Edit")
    and tool.real_file_path != ""
    and not tool.real_file_path pmatch (allowed_write_prefixes)
  output: >
    Falco blocked writing to %tool.real_file_path because it is outside the allowed project directory
  priority: CRITICAL
  source: coding_agent
  tags: [coding_agent_deny]
```

## Common Patterns

**Match Bash commands by prefix** (safer than `contains` — avoids matching substrings):
```yaml
condition: tool.name = "Bash" and tool.input_command startswith "sudo "
```

**Match files by name regardless of directory** (cover both the access name and canonical target):
```yaml
condition: tool.file_name = "Dockerfile" or basename(tool.real_file_path) = "Dockerfile"
```

**Match files inside the working directory** (use `val()` for field comparison):
```yaml
condition: tool.real_file_path = val(agent.real_cwd) or tool.real_file_path startswith val(agent.real_cwd_prefix)
```

**Match files by extension** (use `endswith`):
```yaml
condition: tool.real_file_path endswith ".key" or tool.real_file_path endswith ".pem"
```

**Combine multiple tools**:
```yaml
condition: tool.name in ("Write", "Edit", "Read") and ...
```
